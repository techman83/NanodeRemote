NanodeRemote
============

Nanode remote was originally written by Mark VandeWettering, however I've 
not found a repo or licenses, but he can be found here: 
https://github.com/brainwagon

I've made some changes to better integrate with a project I'm working on:
https://github.com/techman83/NanodeControl

I'd like to make a few more changes, however my C++ fu is a little lacking!
